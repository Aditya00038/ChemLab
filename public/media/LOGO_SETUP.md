# How to Add Your App Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Prepare your logo image:**
   - Square aspect ratio (e.g., 512x512px, 1024x1024px)
   - PNG format with transparent background (recommended)
   - Clear, recognizable design that works at small sizes

2. **Name it:** `app_logo.png`

3. **Place it here:** `public/media/app_logo.png`

4. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```powershell
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Clear browser cache:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)

## Where Your Logo Will Appear:

✅ **Browser Tab** (favicon) - Next to "ChemStock" title
✅ **Dashboard Header** - Top left corner
✅ **Mobile Menu** - Navigation drawer
✅ **PWA App Icon** - When installed as app
✅ **Apple Device Home Screen** - When saved to home screen

## Current Status:

- [ ] Logo file added to `public/media/app_logo.png`
- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] Logo visible in browser tab

## Tips:

- Use a simple, bold design that's recognizable at 16x16px

- Test at multiple sizes
- Consider both light and dark backgrounds

## Example Logo Sources:

- Design in Figma/Canva
